# Trading bots

Trading bots are profit-seeking strategies that interact with Drift markets. These bots typically:

- subscribe to market data (orderbook, trades, oracles),
- compute signals or quotes,
- place and cancel orders, and
- manage risk and collateral.

### Step 1: Choose a strategy

Start with a reference implementation before customizing:

- [Tutorial: JIT Maker Bot](/developers/trading-automation/trading-bots/jit-trading-bot)

### Step 2: Prepare a wallet + RPC

Use a dedicated bot wallet and a reliable RPC provider:

- [Bot wallet setup](/protocol/getting-started/wallet-setup/bot-wallet-setup)
- [RPC providers](/developers/trading-automation/rpc-providers)

### Step 3: Connect and subscribe

Most strategies rely on:

- Drift SDK subscriptions (websocket or polling)
- Orderbook/DLOB updates
- Oracle feeds

For setup patterns, see:

- [Bot architecture patterns](/developers/market-makers/bot-architecture)

### Step 4: Run and monitor

Start in paper mode or with small size. Monitor logs and latency, and track performance over time.
