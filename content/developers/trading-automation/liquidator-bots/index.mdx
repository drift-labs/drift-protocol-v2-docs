# Liquidator Bots

Liquidator bots monitor accounts near liquidation and perform liquidations to keep the protocol healthy. Liquidators inherit risk and must maintain sufficient collateral to take on positions.

### Step 1: Understand liquidation mechanics

Liquidations transfer liability from the liquidated account to the liquidator. For protocol details, see:

- [Liquidations](/protocol/trading/liquidations)

### Step 2: Choose a reference implementation

The canonical bot lives in `keeper-bots-v2`:

- `src/bots/liquidator.ts`
- `src/bots/liquidatorDerisk.ts` (derisk helper)

### Step 3: Prepare the environment

Follow the keeper bots setup and initialize a user account:

- [Keeper Bots](/developers/trading-automation/keeper-bots)

Liquidator bots require collateral. Make sure the wallet is funded and has USDC deposited.

### Step 4: Run and tune

Once configured, run the bot via the `keeper-bots-v2` config file and monitor for:

- RPC latency / timeouts
- competing liquidators
- position risk and exposure

### Step 5: Iterate and harden

Common improvements include:

- filtering markets or subaccounts
- using derisk strategies
- adding guardrails for exposure and max size
