# Trading workflows

This page is for builders who want to execute trades programmatically (with or without a bot). It focuses on the core SDK flow: connect → read markets → place orders → manage risk → manage collateral.

### Step 1: Set up the SDK + wallet

You’ll create a `DriftClient`, connect to RPC, and initialize your wallet and environment.

- [SDK setup](/developers/drift-sdk/setup)

### Step 2: Read markets + oracles

Fetch market metadata, oracle prices, and subscriptions before trading.

- [Markets](/developers/drift-sdk/markets)

### Step 3: Place and cancel orders

Use order helpers for limit/market/oracle/trigger orders, and handle cancels/edits.

- [Orders](/developers/drift-sdk/orders)
- [Users](/developers/drift-sdk/users)

### Step 4: Monitor PnL and risk

Track margin, health, and PnL before and after trades.

- [PnL & risk](/developers/drift-sdk/pnl-risk)
- [Events](/developers/drift-sdk/events)

### Step 5: Manage collateral and exits

Deposit/withdraw collateral, settle PnL, and close positions safely.

- [Deposits & withdrawals](/developers/drift-sdk/deposits-withdrawals)
