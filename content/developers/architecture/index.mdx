# Architecture

This section explains how Drift works under the hood, from Solana program internals to SDK architecture and core trading mechanisms.

## Why understand the architecture?

Whether you're building integrations, running high-performance bots, or contributing to the protocol, understanding Drift's architecture helps you:

- **Build better integrations** - know which data sources to use and how they relate
- **Optimize performance** - understand subscription patterns, account dependencies, and transaction construction
- **Debug effectively** - trace issues from SDK calls through to onchain state changes
- **Contribute confidently** - understand the system well enough to propose improvements
