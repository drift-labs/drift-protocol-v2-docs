# Vault Managers

## How it works

Vaults are delegated trading pools where **depositors** provide capital and a **manager/delegate** trades with it under strict withdrawal rules. Vaults use share-based accounting — when depositors add funds, they receive vault shares proportional to their contribution. Withdrawals work in reverse: shares are redeemed after a cooldown period (redeem period).

Under the hood, each vault has its own Drift user account that the manager trades with. The vault manager has **delegate authority** over this account, allowing them to place orders and manage positions just like any other Drift account. Depositors' funds are pooled in this single account, and PnL affects all share holders proportionally.

Vault parameters control risk and fees: **redeem period** (withdrawal cooldown), **max tokens** (capacity limit), **management fee** (annualized), and **profit share** (performance fee on realized gains). These protect depositors while compensating managers for performance.

## Managing vaults

This guide focuses on the lifecycle and decisions a manager needs to make. You can manage vaults via the CLI (recommended for most operations) or programmatically via the SDK's `VaultClient`. For full CLI flags, see the `drift-vaults` repo.

### Step 1: Understand roles and lifecycle

- **Manager/delegate**: trades for the vault, can update some params.
- **Depositor**: deposits, requests withdrawals, and completes withdrawals after redeem period.

Lifecycle: **create → deposit → trade → request withdraw → wait → withdraw**.

### Step 2: Decide vault parameters

- **`market-index` / `spotMarketIndex`**: deposit token (commonly 0 = USDC)
- **`redeem-period`**: withdrawal cooldown (often 3–7 days)
- **`max-tokens`**: capacity / risk control
- **`management-fee`**: annualized fee
- **`profit-share`**: charged on realized gains
- **`permissioned`** + **`min-deposit-amount`**: onboarding controls

### Step 3: Initialize the vault (manager)

```bash
yarn cli init-vault \
  --name "MyVault" \
  --market-index 0 \
  --redeem-period 604800 \
  --max-tokens 0 \
  --management-fee 200 \
  --profit-share 2000
```

### Step 4: Enable trading + set policies

Optional actions you may take after creation:

- enable margin trading on the vault
- update parameters (redeem period, caps, fees)

```bash
yarn cli manager-update-margin-trading-enabled \
  --vault-address <VAULT_ADDRESS> \
  --enabled true
```

### Step 5: Deposits and withdrawals (depositors)

For permissioned vaults, managers must initialize depositors:

```bash
yarn cli init-vault-depositor \
  --vault-address <VAULT_ADDRESS> \
  --deposit-authority <AUTHORITY_TO_ALLOW_DEPOSIT>
```

Deposits are permissioned or permissionless based on vault settings. Withdrawals are two-step:

- request withdrawal
- wait redeem period
- complete withdrawal

### Step 6: Manager operations

Common manager actions:

- manager deposit/withdraw
- apply profit share across depositors
- view vault state

See the `drift-vaults` CLI docs for the full command list and flags.

### Step 7: Security

- Managers **cannot** withdraw user funds directly.
- Withdrawals are governed by **redeem period** and **share accounting**.
- Managers can usually **decrease** (but not increase) the redeem period.
