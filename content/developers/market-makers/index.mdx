# Market Makers

Market making on Drift involves providing liquidity through resting orders, JIT auctions, or both. This section covers strategies, architecture, and trading mechanisms.

## Getting Started

### [Normal Market Making](./normal-mm)

**Resting orders on the DLOB**

Place limit orders that rest on the orderbook until filled. Earn maker rebates while providing committed liquidity.

**Best for:**
- Passive market making
- Earning maker rebates
- Lower infrastructure requirements
- Traditional orderbook strategies

</div>

### [JIT-Only Market Making](./jit-only)

**Active market making through auctions**

React to incoming taker orders during JIT auctions without maintaining resting orders. Compete for fills at better prices.

**Best for:**
- Active market making
- Low latency requirements
- Dynamic pricing strategies
- Avoiding adverse selection

### [Orderbook & Matching](./orderbook-and-matching)

**How orders are matched and filled**

Learn about the DLOB architecture, liquidity priority (JIT → DLOB → AMM), and how to access orderbook data via HTTP, WebSocket, or SDK.

*Essential reading for understanding execution flow*

### [JIT Auctions](./jit-auctions)

**Just-In-Time auction mechanics**

Deep dive into how JIT auctions work, auction pricing, maker participation, and place-and-make patterns.

*Critical for competitive market making*

### [SWIFT API](./swift-api)

**Ultra-low-latency order feed**

Receive signed taker orders offchain via WebSocket before they hit the auction. Enable sub-second reaction times with SWIFT place-and-make.

**Latency advantage:** 100-500ms faster than onchain feeds

</div>

### [Indicative Quotes](./indicative-quotes)

**Offchain liquidity signaling**

Signal intent to provide liquidity at certain prices without committing onchain orders. Helps with price discovery for takers.

**Use case:** Show liquidity for UI/aggregators
