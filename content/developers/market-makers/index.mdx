# Market Makers

Market making on Drift involves providing liquidity through resting orders, JIT auctions, or both. This section covers strategies, architecture, and trading mechanisms.

## Choosing a Strategy

Drift supports three distinct market making approaches. The right choice depends on your latency infrastructure, capital efficiency goals, and operational complexity tolerance.

| | Normal MM | JIT-only | SWIFT |
|---|---|---|---|
| **How it works** | Resting limit orders on the DLOB | React to taker auctions in real-time | Receive signed taker orders offchain before auction |
| **Latency requirement** | Low (seconds) | Medium (sub-second) | High (100-500ms edge) |
| **Infrastructure** | Simple — place orders, update periodically | Moderate — auction subscriber + fill logic | Advanced — WebSocket feed + fast tx submission |
| **Capital efficiency** | Orders locked on-chain | Capital deployed only when filling | Capital deployed only when filling |
| **Adverse selection** | Higher — resting orders can be picked off | Lower — choose which auctions to fill | Lowest — earliest look at order flow |
| **Maker rebates** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Txs/day (oracle offset)** | ~30 | Varies with flow | Varies with flow |
| **Best for** | Passive MM, low-touch strategies | Active MM, inventory-aware fills | Competitive latency-sensitive MM |

**Recommendation:** Start with **Normal MM** using oracle offset orders (orders float with the oracle automatically, requiring very few transactions). Add **JIT** participation when you want to capture auction flow. Add **SWIFT** when you need the latency edge over other JIT makers.

## Market Making Strategies

<div className="doc-card">

### [Normal Market Making](./normal-mm)

**Resting orders on the DLOB**

Place limit orders that rest on the orderbook until filled. Use oracle offset orders to automatically track the oracle price with minimal transactions. Earn maker rebates while providing committed liquidity.

**Best for:**
- Passive market making
- Earning maker rebates
- Lower infrastructure requirements
- Traditional orderbook strategies

### [JIT-Only Market Making](./jit-only)

**Active market making through auctions**

React to incoming taker orders during JIT auctions without maintaining resting orders. Compete for fills at better prices. Capital is only deployed when you choose to fill.

**Best for:**
- Active market making
- Dynamic pricing strategies
- Avoiding adverse selection
- Selective flow participation

### [Bot Architecture](./bot-architecture)

Production patterns and best practices for building reliable market making bots. Covers priority fees, health monitoring, graceful shutdown, error handling, and operational considerations.

### [Orderbook & Matching](./orderbook-and-matching)

**How orders are matched and filled**

Learn about the DLOB architecture, liquidity priority (JIT → DLOB → AMM), and how to access orderbook data via HTTP, WebSocket, or SDK.

*Essential reading for understanding execution flow*

### [JIT Auctions](./jit-auctions)

**Just-In-Time auction mechanics**

Deep dive into how JIT auctions work, auction pricing, maker participation, and place-and-make patterns.

*Critical for competitive market making*

### [SWIFT API](./swift-api)

**Ultra-low-latency order feed**

Receive signed taker orders offchain via WebSocket before they hit the auction. Enable sub-second reaction times with SWIFT place-and-make.

**Latency advantage:** 100-500ms faster than onchain feeds

</div>

<div className="doc-card">

### [Indicative Quotes](./indicative-quotes)

**Offchain liquidity signaling**

Signal intent to provide liquidity at certain prices without committing onchain orders. Helps with price discovery for takers and aggregator routing.

**Use case:** Show liquidity for UI/aggregators

## Reference Implementations

Drift maintains open-source reference bots in [keeper-bots-v2](https://github.com/drift-labs/keeper-bots-v2):

| Bot | Source | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **FloatingPerpMaker** | [`src/bots/floatingMaker.ts`](https://github.com/drift-labs/keeper-bots-v2/blob/master/src/bots/floatingMaker.ts) | Oracle offset resting orders on DLOB |
| **JitMaker** | [`src/bots/jitMaker.ts`](https://github.com/drift-labs/keeper-bots-v2/blob/master/src/bots/jitMaker.ts) | JIT auction fills using `JitterSniper`/`JitterShotgun` |

> **Tip:** The `FloatingPerpMaker` is the best starting point for understanding oracle offset orders in production. The `JitMaker` shows how to use the [`@drift-labs/jit-proxy`](https://github.com/drift-labs/jit-proxy) library for auction participation.
