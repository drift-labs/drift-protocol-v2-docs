# Swift place-and-make

Complete the **Swift MM** flow by submitting the signed taker order and your maker fill on-chain (place-and-make). The on-chain program expects an `ed25519` verification instruction **before** the “place signed taker order” instruction (transaction introspection). The SDK provides helpers to build the required instruction sequence.

### Build ixs with DriftClient (recommended)

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="getPlaceAndMakeSignedMsgPerpOrderIxs" type="method" owner="DriftClient">
```js
const ixs = await driftClient.getPlaceAndMakeSignedMsgPerpOrderIxs(
  signedSignedMsgOrderParams,
  signedMsgOrderUuid,
  takerInfo,
  makerOrderParams
);
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="placeAndMakeSignedMsgPerpOrder" type="method" owner="DriftClient">
```js
const txSig = await driftClient.placeAndMakeSignedMsgPerpOrder(
  signedSignedMsgOrderParams,
  signedMsgOrderUuid,
  takerInfo,
  makerOrderParams
);
console.log(txSig);
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

### Build maker params from the incoming order

For convenience, use helper builders like `getLimitOrderParams(...)` to create the maker order params you want to place.

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="getLimitOrderParams" type="function">
```js
import { getLimitOrderParams } from "@drift-labs/sdk";
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>
