## Swift order feed

**Swift MM:** receive signed taker orders off-chain over this websocket feed (before the order hits the [JIT auction](/protocol/about-v3/jit-faq)), then [place-and-make](/developers/mm-workflow/swift-place-and-make) on-chain. Makers can inspect the order (direction/size/auction params) and decide how to fill it.

### Subscribe to Swift orders

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="SwiftOrderSubscriber" type="class">
```js
import { SwiftOrderSubscriber } from "@drift-labs/sdk";
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="subscribe" type="method" owner="SwiftOrderSubscriber">
```js
await swiftOrderSubscriber.subscribe(async (orderMessageRaw, signedMessage, isDelegateSigner) => {
  // inspect signedMessage.signedMsgOrderParams
});
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

### Account getter (optional)

If you want to derive the taker’s `UserAccount` for downstream instructions, you can provide a `userAccountGetter` implementation to the subscriber (e.g. backed by `UserMap`).

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="UserMap" type="class">
```js
import { UserMap } from "@drift-labs/sdk";
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>
