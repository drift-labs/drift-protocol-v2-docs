## Orderbook & DLOB

To quote well, you usually need current best bid/ask, depth, and recent flow. Drift exposes multiple ways to access [orderbook](/protocol/about-v3/decentralized-orderbook) state:

- **SDK (local DLOB)** via `UserMap` / `DLOB`
- **SDK (subscription)** via `DLOBSubscriber`
- **Hosted DLOB server** (HTTP) for convenience

### UserMap + DLOB (local)

This approach subscribes to user accounts and builds an in-memory orderbook (DLOB). It’s powerful, but can be heavier than calling a hosted DLOB endpoint.

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="UserMap" type="class">
```js
import { UserMap } from "@drift-labs/sdk";
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="DLOB" type="class">
```js
import { DLOB } from "@drift-labs/sdk";
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

### Auction subscriber (on-chain auctions)

If your workflow is centered around on-chain auctions / JIT, you can subscribe to auction-related updates.

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="AuctionSubscriber" type="class">
```js
import { AuctionSubscriber } from "@drift-labs/sdk";
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

### Detecting Swift orders in on-chain feeds

If you also integrate Swift, you may see the same order “twice”: once off-chain via Swift, and again after it lands on-chain. Use `isSignedMsgOrder(...)` to filter Swift-origin orders.

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="isSignedMsgOrder" type="function">
```js
import { isSignedMsgOrder } from "@drift-labs/sdk";
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>
