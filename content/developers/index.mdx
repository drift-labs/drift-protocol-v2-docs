# Drift for developers

Drift Protocol is an [open-sourced](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v2/), decentralised exchange built on the Solana blockchain, enabling transparent and non-custodial trading on cryptocurrencies.

There are language bindings in [Typescript](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v2/tree/master/sdk) and [Python](https://github.com/drift-labs/driftpy), as well as self-hosted HTTP [gateway](https://github.com/drift-labs/gateway).

# Building on Drift
Drift’s Builder Code (DBC) system enables any builder to build on top of Drift while earning fees for routing trades. More info can be found [here](https://docs.drift.trade/partnerships/DBC)
