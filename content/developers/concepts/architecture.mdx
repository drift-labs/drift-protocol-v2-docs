# Architecture

This section explains how Drift works under the hood, from Solana program internals to SDK architecture and core trading mechanisms.

## Why understand the architecture?

Whether you're building integrations, running high-performance bots, or contributing to the protocol, understanding Drift's architecture helps you:

- **Build better integrations** - know which data sources to use and how they relate
- **Optimize performance** - understand subscription patterns, account dependencies, and transaction construction
- **Debug effectively** - trace issues from SDK calls through to onchain state changes
- **Contribute confidently** - understand the system well enough to propose improvements

## Architecture Overview

Drift's architecture spans three layers:

**Protocol Layer** - Solana program accounts and onchain logic. See [Concepts](/developers/concepts) for program structure and account models.

**SDK Layer** - Client libraries for interacting with the protocol. See [SDK Internals](/developers/drift-sdk/sdk-internals) for subscription patterns and transaction construction.

**Trading Layer** - Orderbook, auctions, and matching engine. See [Market Makers](/developers/market-makers) for DLOB, JIT, and liquidity mechanisms.
