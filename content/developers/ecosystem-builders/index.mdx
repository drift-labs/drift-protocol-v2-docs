# Ecosystem Builders

This workflow is for teams building apps, analytics, or integrations that mirror Drift UI functionality. The goal: use the same data sources the UI uses, and send actions via the SDK.

### Step 1: Decide your data sources

For UI-parity data, Drift uses a mix of:

- **Data API** (historical data, candles, trades)
- **DLOB server** (orderbook + trades websocket)
- **Swift** (signed message orders)

Start here:

- [Reading data (API + websockets)](/developers/ecosystem-builders/reading-data)
- [Orderbook + DLOB websocket](/developers/ecosystem-builders/orderbook-and-ws)

### Step 2: Use drift-common UI building blocks

If you want UI parity, the fastest path is `drift-common` — it contains shared UI utilities, hooks, and components used to render Drift-like markets, accounts, health, and funding views. This is the intended way for ecosystem apps to reuse Drift UI elements instead of re-implementing them from scratch.

### Step 3: Build UI models

Translate protocol data into UI shapes (markets, accounts, positions, funding, health). These views are consistent with how Drift surfaces data to end users.

### Step 4: Send actions with the SDK

Once the UI state is ready, use the SDK to place orders, cancel, and manage accounts:

### Step 5: Keep parity over time

Track API changes and SDK updates, and review the official Data API docs:
