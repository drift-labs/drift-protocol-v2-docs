# Sending actions

Once you have UI state, you can send actions using the Drift SDK.

### Step 1: Initialize a Drift client

Follow SDK setup:

- [SDK setup](/developers/drift-sdk/setup)

### Step 2: Place and cancel orders

Use the SDK’s order helpers for common flows:

- [Orders](/developers/drift-sdk/orders)

### Step 3: Manage collateral and accounts

Deposits, withdrawals, and account lifecycle are covered in:

- [Deposits & withdrawals](/developers/drift-sdk/deposits-withdrawals)
- [Users](/developers/drift-sdk/users)

### Step 4: Monitor risk and health

UI parity requires the same risk/health calculations:

- [PnL & risk](/developers/drift-sdk/pnl-risk)

### Step 5: Keep transaction performance healthy

If you’re batching or sending frequent transactions, consider using priority fees and ALTs (address lookup tables) as described in SDK documentation and bot architecture patterns.
