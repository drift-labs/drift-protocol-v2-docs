# Sending Actions

Once you have UI state, you can send actions using the Drift SDK.

### Step 1: Initialize a Drift client

Follow SDK setup:

- [SDK setup](/developers/drift-sdk/setup)

### Step 2: Place and cancel orders

Use the SDK’s order helpers for common flows:

- [Orders](/developers/drift-sdk/orders)

### Step 3: Manage collateral and accounts

Deposits, withdrawals, and account lifecycle are covered in:

- [Deposits & withdrawals](/developers/drift-sdk/deposits-withdrawals)
- [Users](/developers/drift-sdk/users)

### Step 4: Monitor risk and health

UI parity requires the same risk/health calculations:

- [PnL & risk](/developers/drift-sdk/pnl-risk)

### Step 5: Build custom transactions

For advanced use cases, you can build transactions with multiple instructions:

<SDKDoc>
  <TypeScript name="getPlacePerpOrderIx" type="method" owner="DriftClient">
```js
import { ComputeBudgetProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { getMarketOrderParams, PositionDirection } from "@drift-labs/sdk";

// Get instruction for placing order (doesn't send tx yet)
const orderParams = getMarketOrderParams({
  marketIndex: 0,
  direction: PositionDirection.LONG,
  baseAssetAmount: driftClient.convertToPerpPrecision(1),
});

const placeOrderIx = await driftClient.getPlacePerpOrderIx(orderParams);

// Build transaction with compute budget + order instruction
const tx = await driftClient.txSender.getVersionedTransaction(
  [
    ComputeBudgetProgram.setComputeUnitLimit({ units: 400000 }),
    ComputeBudgetProgram.setComputeUnitPrice({ microLamports: 50000 }),
    placeOrderIx,
  ],
  [], // lookup tables (if any)
  driftClient.wallet.publicKey
);

// Sign and send
const signature = await driftClient.txSender.sendVersionedTransaction(
  tx,
  [],
  driftClient.opts
);
console.log("Transaction:", signature);
```
  </TypeScript>
</SDKDoc>

### Step 6: Keep transaction performance healthy

If you're batching or sending frequent transactions, consider using priority fees and ALTs (address lookup tables) as shown above and described in SDK documentation and bot architecture patterns.
