# Orderbook + DLOB websocket

The DLOB server powers the UI orderbook and trades feed. It exposes a websocket interface and uses a small set of channels.

### Step 1: Connect to the DLOB websocket

Base URL:

- `https://dlob.drift.trade`

You’ll connect to its websocket endpoint (e.g. `wss://dlob.drift.trade/ws`).

### Step 2: Subscribe to channels

Supported channels include:

- `orderbook`
- `orderbook_indicative`
- `trades`
- `heartbeat`

Example subscription message (perp orderbook):

```json
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "channel": "orderbook",
  "marketType": "perp",
  "market": "SOL-PERP",
  "grouping": 10
}
```

Example subscription message (trades):

```json
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "channel": "trades",
  "marketType": "perp",
  "market": "SOL-PERP"
}
```

### Step 3: Handle indicative quotes

Use `orderbook_indicative` to surface indicative quotes for routing and discovery. It uses the same message shape as `orderbook`.

### Step 4: Map symbols consistently

Market symbols match UI markets (e.g. `SOL-PERP`). Keep your market list in sync with the SDK’s market metadata to avoid mismatches.
