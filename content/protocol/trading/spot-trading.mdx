# Spot Trading

Spot Trading is the direct purchase or sale of an asset. The delivery of the assets is immediate and the transaction settles on-chain. Once the spot trade has been confirmed, the settlement will be instantaneous, and you will be able to see the increase or decrease in the asset immediately in your account balances.

Spot trading on Drift v3 uses liquidity from OpenBook DEX as well as our own DLOB. By default, margin trading is not enabled. Learn how to enable it in the next section.

## Enable Spot Margin Trading

Margin needs to be enabled per subaccount. Here's how you can enable margin:

Margin trading allows you to leverage your assets as collateral to borrow funds for the trade. The leverage a trader can take in each spot market is determined by the protocol's risk engine.


<Steps>
### Open Settings
Open Settings in the app.

### Go to Margin Trading
Go to Margin Trading in the left navigation

### Toggle to enable
Click the toggle to enable it for the subaccount you want

### Sign transaction
Sign the wallet transaction to confirm
</Steps>

## FAQ

### Why is Drift's spot market better for takers (versus alternatives)?

Takers enter a JIT auction, which can offer price improvement, and otherwise can fill via an external program. (e.g. Serum).

Takers can also utilise special order types such as oracle-offset limit orders, which appropriately can cap fills using slippage tolerance versus the oracle provider's fair value. This allows ordinary takers on a UI to control swapping at the fairest price, even without access to advanced infrastructure / bots.

### Better for makers (versus alternatives)?

Market makers can provide liquidity to an ongoing JIT auction, removing latency-based adverse selection.

Additionally, as an active market maker, all resting orders earn interest within the protocol's borrow / lend.
