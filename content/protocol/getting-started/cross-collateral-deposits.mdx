# Cross-collateral deposits

By default, markets are quoted in USD and P&L is settled in USDC. All tokens deposited within the protocol can earn yield via Borrow/Lend. Until unrealised P&L is settled into your Balances, it will not earn (if profits) or be charged (if losses) the deposit/borrow interest respectively.

Below is a table of assets supported by Drift Protocol.

Each asset counts towards margin for derivatives trading and has a weight applied to account for their respective volatilities.

> For instance, depositing USDC gives users a 1:1 margin for derivatives trading, but depositing SOL (80% asset weight) means that 80% of the value of your SOL at the opening of your position will be available as margin for perpetual futures trading.

**JLP Pool Asset Weights**

**Exponent Pool Asset Weights**

Initial Asset Weights are also scaled lower based on notional value of total deposits. As a reference, you can check out UI or the SpotMarket `get_scaled_initial_weight_asset` for this scale factor.

The IMF Factor acts as a discount on account size:

`Initial Asset Weight` on 2000 SOL Collateral (using above) would be:

`weight = min (.80, 1.1 / [ 1 + (0.003 * sqrt(2000)] )`

`= min(.80, ~.96987) = .80`

An asset's liability weight can be converted into an LTV ratio using:

`ltv = 1 / liability weight`

**Main Pool LTVs**

**JLP Pool LTVs**

**Exponent Pool LTVs**
