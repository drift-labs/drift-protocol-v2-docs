# Metamask Setup

With CONNECT by Drift, MetaMask can be used to trade and sign transactions on Drift. CONNECT by Drift is an open source wallet extension that is powered by [MetaMask Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps/), an innovation that extends the functionality of the MetaMask platform to other chains.

> Note: MetaMask Snaps is in open beta and is available for you to use at your own risk. If you're experiencing any issues, you can reach out to our team via [discord](https://discord.gg/YaK2a5ge).

## Getting Started

<Steps>
### Connect your MetaMask wallet

Click connect in the top right corner to get started. If you have MetaMask already installed, CONNECT will automatically detect this. Select MetaMask to continue.

### Connect to Drift

Next, you'll be prompted to connect to Drift via MetaMask Snaps.

Once you connect, a new Solana compatible wallet will be automatically created for you in MetaMask.

### Fund your wallet

To start trading on Drift, your new MetaMask wallet will need some SOL for transaction fees and you'll need to deposit collateral to Drift. The onboarding flow will guide you from one step to the next.

You can use [Mayan Cross Chain Swaps](https://mayan.finance/) to bridge assets over from your EVM wallet to your Solana wallet, including gas drop off, all in one step!

If you'd like to fund your new MetaMask wallet from another Solana wallet, select "Fund from another wallet" for a step-by-step guide.

### Deposit Collateral to Drift

Once funds have been added to the wallet, you're now ready to deposit collateral to Drift for trading.
