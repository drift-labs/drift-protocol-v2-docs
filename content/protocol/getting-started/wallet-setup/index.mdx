# Wallet Setup

Drift supports a variety of Solana-compatible crypto wallets that allow you to connect your self-custodial wallet to the protocol to trade, deposit, withdraw, and manage your positions. Common options include popular Solana wallets like Phantom, Backpack, Solflare and others that implement the necessary connection standards so you can sign transactions and interact with Drift’s on-chain smart contracts. While some multi-chain wallets also work at a basic level, Phantom is widely recommended as the go-to option due to its strong Solana integration, intuitive interface, broad dApp support, and seamless connection flow on both desktop and mobile — making it especially smooth for setting up your Drift account and managing collateral and trades.
