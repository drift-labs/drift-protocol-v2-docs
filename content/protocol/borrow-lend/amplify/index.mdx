# How it works

Amplify is a **leveraging solution** that enhances exposure to **yield-generating assets** through **recursive borrowing**.

It operates with two asset types:

- **Collateral Asset**: A yield-bearing asset users deposit to open an Amplify position e.g. dSOL, JLP, JitoSOL
- **Borrowing Asset**: Borrowed against the Collateral Asset up to the user's chosen leverage ratio

## Getting Started

<Steps>
### Deposit collateral
Deposit a **Collateral Asset** into **Drift Earn's Borrow/Lend program (Isolated Pool)** via Amplify

### Borrow
System automatically borrows a **Borrowing Asset** against it, adjusting up to the intended leverage ratio

### Conversion & Increased exposure
System automatically converts the Borrowing Asset into the Collateral Asset, **increasing notional exposure** and **amplifying yield potential**

Amplify Fees

Drift does not charge any commissions or fees for using Amplify. However, opening or closing an Amplify position requires swapping one asset to another, which is done via a third-party service that may apply a swap fee.
