# Per Market Leverage

Per market leverage introduces **market specific leverage limits**, giving traders finer control over their positions while improving account safety.

Instead of every position sharing a single account level limit, each perpetual market now defines its own **maximum leverage cap**.

This allows higher leverage on stable assets and stricter limits on more volatile ones.

## How Per Market Leverage Works

Each perpetual position stores its own `max_margin_ratio`, which defines the maximum leverage allowed for that market.

When checking a position, Drift compares:

`effective_margin_ratio = min(position.max_margin_ratio, account.max_margin_ratio)`

| Market | Account Limit | Market Limit | Effective Leverage | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BTC-PERP | 10x | 20x | **10x** | Account limit applies |
| PUMP-PERP | 10x | 5x | **5x** | Market limit applies |

The lower value is always used, ensuring positions can’t exceed the most conservative limit.

From this ratio, the protocol calculates the **maximum position size** a trader can open with their available collateral, and the **liquidation threshold** for that specific position.

## Risk and Control

Previously, all risk was managed at the account level, which meant that a large loss in one market could impact every position.

With per market leverage, each market is evaluated independently. Furthermore, per market leverage gives traders more flexibility and control:

- Apply different leverage levels for different strategies or market conditions.
- High-risk markets can be capped without restricting more stable ones.
- Because risk is contained at the market level, traders eliminate the chance of cascading liquidations.
- Each market’s leverage and liquidation levels are clear and more predictable.

> Example: A trader runs 10x leverage on BTC-PERP and 5x leverage on PUMP-PERP. If PUMP-PERP is liquidated, BTC-PERP remains unaffected, keeping the rest of the account stable.

## Code Implementation

Per-market leverage logic is implemented in:

- `perp_positions.rs` stores `max_margin_ratio`
- `updateUserPerpPositionCustomMarginRatio` updates per position settings

The implementation can be found [here.](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v2/blob/3bb3d407146408a9e08816bcc72a903560013eb7/sdk/src/driftClient.ts#L1541)
