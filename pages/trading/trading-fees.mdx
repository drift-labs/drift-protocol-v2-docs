# Trading Fees

Trading fees on Drift are calculated on a per-trade basis and are based on the filled notional position size.

Trading fees are calculated in the market's quote asset (USDC) and show up in Perpetual Markets as a penalty on the cost basis of position. In the circumstance where a user only holds non-USDC assets on Drift, a borrow for USDC will only appear upon someone settling that perp position's loss (see [P&L](/profit-loss/profit-loss-intro)).

Drift Protocol has a tiered fee structure for all futures markets based on an on-chain calculation of 30-Day Volume\*.

**Tier 2 -- 9 bps**: Either stake more than 500 *or\* trade over 1m in volume (30D average).

**Tier 3 -- 8 bps**: Either stake more than 1K *or\* trade over 5m in volume (30D average).

### Maker Fees

Makers are provided with a flat 1bps rebate regardless of the Taker Fee paid.

### Referee Discount / Referer Reward

These apply to accounts that were signed up using a referred account. These percentages are applied to the effective taker fee paid.

### Filler Reward

Filler rewards are variable but up to 10% of the effective taker fee paid by the user. See [Keeper Incentives](/about-v2/keeper-incentives).

### Spot Fees
Spot Fees are set per market. Most major markets have 5 bps taker and 1bps rebate for maker. While most longer tail assets can have increased fees (~10 bps) to stay in line with external markets fee schedules.
