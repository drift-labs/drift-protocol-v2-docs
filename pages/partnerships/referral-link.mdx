# Referral Links

Create your own referral link today and boost your earnings when you refer new users to trade on Drift! For every new user you bring to Drift, you will earn a portion of their trading fees as a reward for bringing on a new user!

Referrers earn **15%** of the fees from users they refer to Drift, and the referred user will also receive a discount of **5%** off their fees! This document will walk you through setting up your referral link to begin earning today.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Rewards for the referrer accrue only from taker volume.
</Callout>

`current_epoch_referrer_rewards` are capped at 4000 USDC per epoch (28 days); the next epoch begins when the cluster time passes `next_epoch_ts` on the UserStats account.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
The referral link applies solely to *new* Drift accounts created through your link. For it to apply, users must have clicked the link, connected their wallet, and made a deposit within the same session.

1. First, in order to create your own ref link you must click on the “Overview” tab inside the Drift app. Once there you will want to scroll down to where it says “Referrals”.
