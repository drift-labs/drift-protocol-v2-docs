## How Rewards Work

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Note:** We use syrupUSDC to illustrate the incentive structure. The same rules, mechanics, and reward calculations apply to any future promotions unless stated otherwise.
</Callout>

**Deposit syrupUSDC as collateral** for an active perpetual position to start earning rewards.

- Incentives accrue continuously and are distributed among participants who meet **both** criteria:
  1. Have syrupUSDC deposited as collateral.
  2. Maintain an active perpetual position.

Your share of rewards is based on:

```
min(deposited syrupUSDC, open perp notional)
```

This means rewards are aligned with both your syrupUSDC balance and your trading activity.

## Maximizing Rewards

To earn the most from incentives:

- Keep your **open interest (OI)** in perpetuals **higher** than your deposited syrupUSDC balance.
- Maintain active positions during the reward cycle to maximize accrual.
- Monitor your collateral and notional exposure to avoid being capped by the `min()` rule above.
