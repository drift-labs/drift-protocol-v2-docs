# Cross-collateral deposits

By default, markets are quoted in USD and P&L is settled in USDC. All tokens deposited within the protocol can earn yield via Borrow/Lend. Until unrealised P&L is settled into your Balances, it will not earn (if profits) or be charged (if losses) the deposit/borrow interest respectively.

Below is a table of assets supported by Drift Protocol.

Each asset counts towards margin for derivatives trading and has a weight applied to account for their respective volatilities.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  For instance, depositing USDC gives users a 1:1 margin for derivatives
  trading, but depositing SOL (80% asset weight) means that 80% of the value of
  your SOL at the opening of your position will be available as margin for
  perpetual futures trading.

Initial Asset Weights are adjusted downward based on the notional value of total deposits. This adjustment ensures that larger deposits are appropriately risk-weighted. For more details on how this scaling factor is calculated, refer to the UI or consult the [`get_scaled_initial_asset_weight`](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v2/blob/87642b7457b5d1b7babcfff59fa12aa97d1fd58e/programs/drift/src/state/spot_market.rs#L337) method in the SpotMarket.

The IMF (Initial Margin Factor) acts as a discount on the account size. It adjusts the initial asset weight based on the size of the collateral, incorporating a scaling factor to manage risk.

<Callout type="info" emoji="⬇️">
**Example calculation for the initial asset weight for 2000 SOL collateral**

Given a collateral amount of 2000 SOL, the **initial asset weight** can be calculated as follows:

`weight = min (.80, 1.1 / [ 1 + (0.003 * sqrt(2000)] )`

`= min(.80, ~.96987) = .80`
</Callout>

An asset's liability weight can be converted into an LTV ratio using:

`ltv = 1 / liability weight`

| **Asset**     | **Initial LTV** | **Max LTV** |
