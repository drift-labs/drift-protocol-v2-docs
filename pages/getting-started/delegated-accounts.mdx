# Delegated Accounts

## What is a Delegated Account?  

This feature allows users to grant another Solana account limited access to their account on Drift. Users using Drift's account delegation feature may wish to delegate trading execution to a professional trading team. Each subaccount on Drift has its own delegate parameter.

### What can a Delegated Account do?  

Delegated authorities on Drift can **ONLY**:  

-   deposit funds;

-   swap assets;

-   place and cancel orders.

Users can only delegate access to one account or authority. It's important to note that full control over the account remains with the owner.

A delegated party can **NOT**:  

-   borrow/withdraw funds;  

-   close the account; and/or

-   change or remove existing account delegation parameters.

-   change any settings

Delegated authorities can only deposit funds, place orders and cancel orders and are therefore limited in their abilities. All other actions must be taken by the account owner.

### How do I delegate access to my account?  

To delegate access to another Solana account using Drift's UI, go to the **Overview** tab and click on **Manage Subaccounts**. In this section, you'll find the option to set up a delegate account, as shown in the image below.

### Hardware Wallets

If you are using a hardware wallet such as Ledger to connect to Drift via a wallet provider (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack), you may encounter errors when signing certain orders.

To ensure a seamless trading experience, we recommend creating a **delegate account**. This allows you to continue trading on Drift, while maintaining the security benefits of using your hardware wallet.

Please follow the guide above to set up a delegate account from your hardware wallet.
