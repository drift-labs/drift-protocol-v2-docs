# WLFI Trading Campaign

## Campaign Overview

Drift has partnered with World Liberty Financial to launch a trading leaderboard campaign that rewards users for trading on Drift Perps using USD1 as collateral.

<Steps>
### Rewards

A total of 1,000,000 WLFI tokens per round will be allocated to this campaign and distributed to the top 150 traders based on their leaderboard ranking.

### Campaign Period

- Round 1: 20 Jan 2026 00:00 UTC – 19 Feb 2026 00:00 UTC

Each round runs for approximately one month.

### How It Works

Users earn leaderboard points by trading on Drift while using USD1 (issued by World Liberty Financial) as part of their collateral. All perpetual markets on Drift are eligible, and rewards are distributed directly to users’ wallets within 14 days after the end of each round.

## Point mechanics

Only Qualified volume counts toward leaderboard points.

Qualified volume is calculated based on the proportion of USD1 in a user’s collateral at the account level. For wallets with multiple accounts, points are aggregated at the wallet level.

### Example 1:

- If 30% of an account’s collateral is USD1, then 30% of that account’s trading volume is counted as qualified volume

### Example 2:

- A wallet has three (sub)accounts, each trading $1,000,000
  - Account A: 50% USD1 → $500,000 qualified volume
  - Account B: 30% USD1 → $300,000 qualified volume
  - Account C: 0% USD1 → $0 qualified volume

Total qualified volume for the wallet: $800,000

## Rewards

At the end of each round, the top 150 wallets on the leaderboard will receive WLFI rewards based on their final ranking.

Rewards are fixed by rank and paid from the rewards pool of 1,000,000 WLFI.

| Ranking   | Reward (% of pool) | WLFI per wallet  |

| #1        | 5%                 | 50,000 WLFI      |

| #6–10     | 2% each            | 20,000 WLFI each |
| #11–20    | 1% each            | 10,000 WLFI each |

| #76–150   | 0.3% each          | 3,000 WLFI each  |
