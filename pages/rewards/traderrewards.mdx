# Drift Trader Rewards Program

Drift is launching a **Trader Rewards Program** in addition to the Maker Rewards Program.

#### Epoch 1 (October 1-31)

- **Reward Pool:** **1,000,000 DRIFT**
- **Epoch Length:** 1 calendar month 

> ✅ This epoch has concluded

#### Epoch 2 (Start: November)

- **Reward Pool:** **1,000,000 DRIFT**
- **Epoch Length:** 1 calendar month 

> ✅ This epoch has concluded

### Reward Allocation

Contrary to the Maker Rewards Program, the Traders Rewards Program will incentivize a few selected markets for their **taker** volume. For epoch 2 these include:

> BTC-PERP, ETH-PERP, SOL-PERP

**Rewards will be calculated along a Pro-Rata Volume Bonus**

Rewards are distributed across markets based on the share of total taker volume across protocol during epoch, and are allocated linearly.

The set of markets and minimums may change each epoch. A full schedule of trading fees and rebates per market can be found [here](https://docs.drift.trade/trading-fees).

### Example Calculation

**Taker Volumes for Epoch:**

- Taker 1: 100M BTC-PERP, 10M SOL-PERP → Total: 110M
- Taker 2: 50M BTC-PERP, 40M SOL-PERP → Total: 90M
- **Total Taker Volume:** 200M

**Step 1 - Market Rewards:**

- SOL-PERP: 1,000,000 × 50/200 = **250,000** **DRIFT**
- BTC-PERP: 1,000,000 × 150/200 =  **750,000 DRIFT**

**Step 2 - Trader Rewards:**

- Taker 1: (250,000 x 10/50) + (750,000 x 100/150) = **550,000 DRIFT**
- Taker 2: (250,000 x 40/50) + (750,000 x 50/150) = **450,000 DRIFT**

### Real-Time Leaderboard & Reward Estimates

The [**live leaderboard**](https://app.drift.trade/leaderboard/taker) displays:

- Current ranking of all qualifying participants.
- Taker-specific share of market volume.
- Estimated DRIFT rewards earned to date (based on current volumes and allocation formula).

Estimates update in near real-time, giving makers visibility into their performance and potential payout before the epoch ends. Final rewards are calculated at epoch close.  And are to be distributed as Staked DRIFT within 7 working days after the epoch closes.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Participants must trade **≥$10K volume** in the monthly cycle **and** qualify for **≥1 DRIFT**. If either condition is not met, rewards are forfeited and redistributed **pro-rata** to eligible participants.
