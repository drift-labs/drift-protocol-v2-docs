# Backstop AMM Liquidity (BAL)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**As part of our transition to the upcoming Drift Liquidity Provider (DLP) token, The Backstop AMM Liquidity (BAL) program will be fully decommissioned on 7 August at 00:00 UTC+0.**
</Callout>

## Overview

Backstop AMM Liquidity (BAL) is a way for users can opt provide backstop liquidity to selected markets. This action increases liquidity in the market's virtual Automated Market Maker (AMM), enhancing execution quality for other users by reducing price impact.

Adding shares to the Liquidity provision involves boosting `sqrtK` for the AMM's oracle-based constant product liquidity. Increasing `sqrtK` thereby increasing the liquidity pool. Notably, liquidity added to perpetuals markets is cross-margined within Drift, allowing users to earn lending interest and access capital for margin trading.

For a detailed understanding of BAL functionality, refer to the [BAL Technical Explainer](/backstop-amm-liquidity/bal-provider-overview).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
BAL involves leverage and opens perpetual positions on behalf of the user.

This requires the user to actively manage their account's inventory / risk for best results.

Before using BAL, even with low leverage, please read through all the documentation careful.

</Callout>

### Getting Started with BAL

You’ll take on a share of the AMM’s positions as a counterparty to other Drift traders. For example, if a Drift trader goes short, you’ll receive a long position.

Your liquidity is represented as open orders (bids/asks) and you’ll see your BAL positions in the positions table:

### Position Updates & Management

Adding BAL shares, As new trades are filled, your perp position in that market can be updated.

Reducing BAL shares reduces the flow of updates to that market's perp position.

The exact flow of position depends on the fill action vs the AMM (this can be a proto-rata split of protocol-owned and user-owned liquidity or just one or the other). Note that BAL does not get a share of AMM/JIT split fills.

The AMM can fill as a backstop and participate along side other user maker orders to partially rebalance inventory.

You can manage your risk manually by reducing the perp position or closing it via the close button in the positions table.

### Setting max leverage for your subaccount

A subaccount max leverage is suggested when you add liquidity but can be adjusted in the settings. This setting adjusts your margin requirement for increasing BAL positions. If your account falls below the collateral requirement shown on BAL page, the next P&L settle will trigger de-risking of the position. You can also opt out of this in Margin/Leverage Settings.
