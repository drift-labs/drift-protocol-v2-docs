## Overview

FUEL is Drift’s first on-chain loyalty program for Driftoors designed to recognise those who continue to use Drift and are active participants in its mission. Your activity won’t go unrecognized — whether you’re actively trading perps or staking you can now kick things into high gear with FUEL. 

The FUEL program has been designed to take into consideration a broad range of activity throughout the Drift ecosystem. Your activity is represented with each FUEL you earn and you’ll be able to accelerate even faster with Activity Boosters.

## How do I Earn Fuel?

Watch your FUEL grow with each click. FUEL earnings are continuously added to your account while performing various actions on Drift, and can be viewed at [app.drift.trade/fuel](http://app.drift.trade/fuel). The total FUEL earned reflects the activity across all of your subaccounts.

The following activities on Drift earn FUEL:
<FuelBaseRatesTable />

Taker and maker FUEL earnings are added to your account immediately as the activity is completed.

All earn rates that are time-based, such as DRIFT staking, are also continuously added, but the amount is divided over a 28-day period. Example: if you stake 100 DRIFT, and the earn rate is 10 FUEL per DRIFT staked for 28 days, after one day you will have earned about 35.7 FUEL (10 FUEL / 28 days * 100 DRIFT).

As the FUEL program continues to be rolled out, rewards for other activities like deposits/lending, borrowing, and having open interest may be added in the future.

## What are Boosters?

Activity boosters provide an accelerated earn rate for different activities. The boosted rate is multiplied with the base earn rate for the activity. Example: if the base earn rate for taker volume is 1 FUEL for every \$1, and there's a booster of 5x in SOL-PERP, then the earn rate for SOL-PERP becomes 5 FUEL for every \$1 in taker volume as long as the booster is active.

All currently active boosters and their rates can be found at: [app.drift.trade/fuel](http://app.drift.trade/fuel).

## What can I redeem FUEL for?

In the future, you’ll be able to redeem your FUEL for DRIFT. The Drift DAO [passed a proposal](https://app.realms.today/dao/DRIFT/proposal/9s2FsXuKwbcBTZFNhy1jBiLKFYDCz52vBixw9oZfeyaC) for the Season 1 Fuel Campaign. The details are as follows:

### Summary of Season 1 Fuel Campaign

Over the past year, Drift has distributed ~12% of total token supply to reward community members and foster growth as part of the initial TGE in May. Now, with FUEL, Drift is building on that foundation:

Up to 7.82% of the total DRIFT supply will be allocated through a milestone-based campaign.
Real trading activity will be recognised, wash trading disqualified, and all users will be treated equally via Linear Distribution mechanism (no tiers).
Drift is continuing its commitment to community ownership by ensuring the distribution of DRIFT tokens over the coming years, aligning users with the protocol’s long-term vision and success.
Our goal is simple: grow Solana DeFi and solidify Drift as the premier home of DeFi on Solana.

### Token Supply

This proposal suggests allocating a maximum of 7.82% of the total Drift token supply for distribution via the FUEL S2 campaign, concluding in June 2025. This 7.82% comes from:

7% from the Community & Ecosystem allocation
0.82% rolled forward from previously unclaimed TGE tokens
Currently, 8.2 million DRIFT is set aside for FUEL (per a prior governance vote, details here), originating from unclaimed DRIFT tokens from the first airdrop in May 2024.

### Milestone-Based Amount

The total DRIFT allocation for FUEL will scale with Drift’s trading volume success. If the community and protocol excel in driving volume, more tokens become available for claiming.

### Milestones

Milestone 1: 15B Total Perp Volume

Milestone 2: 25B Total Perp Volume

Milestone 3: 40B Total Perp Volume

Milestone 4: 60B Total Perp Volume

Milestone 5: 100B Total Perp Volume

### Milestone Amounts (On top of the existing 8.2M)

No Milestones Hit: 28.2M DRIFT (2.82% of total supply)

Milestone 1: 38.2M DRIFT (3.82% of total supply)

Milestone 2: 48.2M DRIFT (4.82% of total supply)

Milestone 3: 58.2M DRIFT (5.82% of total supply)

Milestone 4: 68.2M DRIFT (6.82% of total supply)

Milestone 5: 78.2M DRIFT (7.82% of total supply)

Note: Milestone success is measured by total Perp Market Volume from campaign start (When vote is finalized) through campaign end (June 2025).

### Why These Milestones

Achieving all milestones would place Drift among the top three derivatives platforms in crypto, and number one on Solana. This will demonstrate that the future of DeFi is Solana DeFi.

### Wash Trading Protection

To ensure organic trading volume, the Drift core team will actively monitor for suspicious activity. Accounts identified as engaging in wash trading or other manipulative behaviors will be flagged for disqualification from FUEL distribution. This ensures fairness for all legitimate participants.

### Linear Distribution

This will be a linear distribution. A linear distribution will ensure the commensurate recognition of users who’ve contributed most to Drift’s growth.

Linear means no tiers and no minimum or maximum FUEL amounts. It means there will be no need to identify sybils as there will be no advantage to sybils. All Drift users will be considered equal.

### Claim Mechanism & Vest

Most Users: Receive an immediate unlock of their DRIFT upon claiming.
Largest Users: A small subset of top holders will be subject to a 9-month vest (no cliff) to maintain strong alignment with the protocol’s long-term growth.
This mirrors the TGE structure, where largest holders also had a vesting schedule.

### Timeline

Start: ~17 Feb 2025 (post-governance vote)
End: ~June 2025
Extending the campaign to June coincides with upcoming liquidity upgrades, ensuring all new and existing users get the best experience possible.
