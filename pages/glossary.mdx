| Peg Multiplier      | means the magnitude of the quote asset reserve. For instance, one virtual quote asset reserve is a peg multiplier amount of the quote asset. A peg multiplier ensures that the base asset reserve and the quote asset reserve are balanced at the initialisation of the curve while ensuring that the starting price of the pool is equivalent to the oracle price of the base asset at initialisation. |
| Reserve Price       | in the AMM, is defined as `(quote_asset_reserve * peg_multiplier)  / base_asset_reserve`. It is the true reserves price prior to any spread logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Bid Price           | is the Price available to sell from the AMM, before slippage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ask Price           | is the Price available to buy from the AMM, before slippage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mark Price          | means the Market Price. Average of current Bid and Ask Price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Oracle Price        | means the latest composite price from oracles. Oracle price is interchangeable with index price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Repeg               | means modifying the peg multiplier which means re-pegging the curve such that the mark price is closer to the oracle price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Adjusting K         | means modifying the curve's invariant `k` by scaling the base/quote asset reserves. For instance, this modifies the default slippage of a swap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Terminal Price      | means the mark price if all users atomically closed their positions and no repegs/k adjustments occurred (should be equal to the peg multiplier if all k adjustments were done during a balanced market).                                                                                                                                                                                               |
