# Maker Rebate Fees

_For more information on our fee tiers, please see [trading fees](https://docs.drift.trade/trading/trading-fees)_

The below fee schedule details the rebates provided to Market Makers that have their orders filled by other users on the platform.  

In order to ensure an order is a maker order, it will need the 'post only' flag. Otherwise even resting orders can match as a taker.

The current incentive program will be subject to change. All changes will be reflected in this schedule.  

For non-btc/eth perpetuals:

| **Taker** | **Maker Fee (flat Maker Fee regardless of Taker Fee)** |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| AMM       | -.25bps                                                   |
| User      | -.25bps                                                  |
