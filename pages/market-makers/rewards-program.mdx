# Drift Market Maker Reward Program 

Drift launched a **Market Maker Rewards Program** for qualified participants.

#### Epoch 1 (September 1-30)

- **Reward Pool:** **2,000,000 DRIFT**
- **Epoch Length:** 1 calendar month 

> ✅ This epoch has concluded


#### Epoch 2 (Start: October)

- **Reward Pool:** **1,000,000 DRIFT**
- **Epoch Length:** 1 calendar month 

> ⚠️ This epoch will start in October.


### Reward Allocation

Each listed market receives:

1. **Minimum Reward**
    - **XRP, FARTCOIN, WIF, BONK, PUMP, HYPE, SUI, DOGE, DRIFT, PENGU, and any new listings**
        - **20,000 DRIFT** (1% of pool)
    - **All other markets (~48 markets)**
        - **5,000 DRIFT** (0.25% of pool)
2. **Pro-Rata Volume Bonus**
    - Remaining pool (after minimums per market) is distributed across markets based on the share of total maker volume across protocol from the prior epoch.
    - With 10 markets at 1% minimum and remaining 48 active markets at .25% minimum, **this leaves 78% of rewards distributed pro-rata on total maker volume**.

Please note, BTC-PERP, ETH-PERP and SOL-PERP are excluded from total maker volume.

The set of markets and minimums may change each epoch. A full schedule of trading fees and rebates per market can be found [here](https://docs.drift.trade/trading-fees).

### Example Calculation

**Maker Volumes for Epoch 1:**

- Maker 1: 100M SUI-PERP, 5M DOGE-PERP → Total: 105M
- Maker 2: 50M SUI-PERP, 20M DOGE-PERP → Total: 70M
- **Total Maker Volume:** 175M

**Step 1 - Remaining Pro-rata Volume Pool:**

2,000,000 – (20,000 × 2) = **1,960,000 DRIFT**

**Step 2 - Market Rewards:**

- DOGE-PERP: 20,000 + (1,960,000 × 25/175) = **300,000 DRIFT**
- SUI-PERP: 20,000 + (1,960,000 × 150/175) = **1,700,000 DRIFT**

**Step 3 - Maker Rewards:**

- Maker 1: (300,000 x 5/25) + (1,700,000 x 100/150) = **1,193,333.33 DRIFT**
- Maker 2: (300,000 x 20/25) + (1,700,000 x 50/150) = **806,666.67 DRIFT**

### Leaderboard & Reward Estimates

The live [leaderboard](https://app.drift.trade/leaderboard/maker) displays:
