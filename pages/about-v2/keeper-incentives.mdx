# Keeper Incentives

Keepers **keep** the Drift network healthy.

## Keeper Rewards

For matching orders, Keepers receive a portion of the taker fee.

For cancelling orders (that can be cancelled see [Advanced Orders FAQ](/trading/advanced-orders-faq)), Keepers will receive the `cancel_order_fee` on the state.

Liquidation rewards for keepers are different for every market and range from 0.75% to 3% of the amount liquidated. See [Fee schedule](https://driftv2.streamlit.app/?tab=Fee-Schedule).

Currently, the USDC reward function for keepers (_f_keeper_) is designed as:

$
f_{\text{keeper}} = \textit{min}(0.01 \ast 
\textit{max}\left(1, t_{\text{order}}\right)^
{1/4}, 0.1 \ast f_{\text{user}})
$

where:
$t_{\text{order}}$ is seconds since the order was placed
$f_{\text{user}}$ is the taker fee paid by the user who placed the order

This reward is subject to evolve to incentivise CLOB-like execution ordering. See [source code](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v1/blob/c748c64fcfa6d7fd5aba72f7021218dd6aaa02f0/programs/clearing_house/src/math/fees.rs#L257) for the on-chain calculation.

A Keeper reward multiplier (for taker price improvement) is applied to the keeper's minimum time-based reward component in the function above. Any percent improvement versus the baseline `oracle +/- 10bps`, increases this multiplier.

### Future Work

30d fill volume for keepers is tracked on-chain via `UserStats`, allowing for logic to reward consistent keepers with a larger multiplier on rewards.
