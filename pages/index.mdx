## 📈 Trade

Focus on the strategy, and let Drift take care of your position:

- [**Perpetual Futures / Swaps**](/trading/perpetuals-trading) - Trade the hottest perp markets with up to 10x leverage.
- [**Spot Trading**](/trading/spot-margin-trading) - Trade assets with up to 5x leverage.
- [**Swap Tokens**](https://app.drift.trade/swap) - Swap any pair with up to 5x leverage.

Drift was designed with a goal to be **capital efficient but also protective of your assets.**

We achieved that by setting up sophisticated **cross-margined risk engine** - a system of tools with an extensive protection from over-extending risk. For instance:

- In the lend/borrow markets, you can also use collateral for perpetual futures and trade more efficiently with spot assets.
- Every token you deposit can earn you more through borrowing and also act as a collateral for perpetual swaps.
- Borrowers can only borrow if they have more collateral than needed, following multiple safety measures for extra protection.
